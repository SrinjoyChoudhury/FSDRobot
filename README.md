# FSDRobot
Autonomous Robot Car built with my Raspberry Pi, YOLOV8, an Arduino, and some help from my PC. 

Electronic Components Used: 
- Raspberry Pi Model 4
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- L298n motor driver
- 4 DC gearbox motors 
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- A PC that can run PyTorch models relatively well

Video detailing the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h90fW9QRp7o&t=8s&ab_channel=SrinjoyChoudhury

The function that you'll want to run on your computer is "DeploymentV8Shared.py", 
run "arduinoBluetoothComms.ino" on the Arduino,
and run "ExodusClient.py" on the Raspberry Pi

Good luck have fun :)
